Note: There are 5 questions in this lab exercise. These will form the 5 multi-choice quiz for the lab. As you work through the lab please record your answers to the questions so you can enter them into the quiz later. 


For this excercise, we are going to use data on western rock lobster that is collected by UWA Marine Science Masters students every year at Rottnest Island.

Each year, as part of BIOL4408 - Marine Ecology, students estimate the abundance and size of western rock lobster at multiples sites inside and outside three of the no-take Marine Reserves around Rottnest Island.

We now have over 7 years of data from over 3,900 snorkel survey samples.

However, we will use a broad summary of the data for this example of a control vs impact comparison.

It is interesting to consider, which is the control and which is the impact? Is the no-take Marine Reserve a control or impact?



Load extra librarys
```{r libs2, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(RCurl) # to read data from GitHub
library(tidyr) #to tidy data
library(dplyr) #to transform data
library(ggplot2) #to plot data
library(lsmeans) #for pairwise comparisons
```


We are going to ask you to you some additional librarys from the [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) family of packages.

In particular we are going to introduce the use of the pipe %>% operator the chain functions together and the ggplot() function to make plots.

For a short introduction to pipes %>% see [Introduction-to-tidyverse-and-pipes](https://github.com/UWA-SBS-Intro-to-R-RStudio-Tidyverse/Introduction-to-tidyverse-and-pipes/blob/master/Using-tidyverse-and-pipes.md).


Read in the lobster data from GitHub. We will also use filter() to select two of the three no-take marine reserve/sanctuary locations (Armstrong Bay and Green island) AND only those lobster greater than the minimum size of legal retention. So we are now only looking at data on those lobster we expect to experience fishing mortality in the fished areas.
```{r read, message=TRUE, warning=FALSE}

dat<-read.csv(text=getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/No-take-marine-reserves/master/lobster.density.csv"))%>%
  filter(sanctuary%in%c("Armstrong Bay","Green Island"))%>%
  filter(size.class=="legal")

```

Let's have a look at the data
```{r}
head(dat)
```

The data has 10 columns. It also has 1511 rows, each corresponding to a snorkel survey.  

Lets just focus on two columns for now:
- count is how many legal sized lobster the BIOL4408 student observed when swimming a 10m2 area at the site
- status describes whether surveyed site is a "No-take" site or a "fished" site

You will notive that R can hold data in a variety of forms. We can understand our data a bit better by using the str() function

```{r}
str(dat)
```

Notice that the count variable is being stored in R as an integer (int) while the status variable is being stored as a factor with two levels: "Fished" and "No-take". It is often important to understand how R is storing your data. There are a wide range of data classess in R including integer (count data), numeric (non-whole numbers), character (text that is not being used in analysis), factor(text that is being used in analysis) and many more. 

For now, it makes sense that count is recognised as an integer, and status as a factor, so we will leave the data as it is for the analysis. 

## Explore the data using a mean and SE plot of the greater than legal size lobster

The first quetion we will ask this data is whether the density of legal sized lobster is greater inside the No-take areas compared to the fished area? 

Lets tackle this question visually by creating a plot of the density of legal sized lobster (per 10m2 snorkel survey) in the Fished and No-take areas. 

To enable plotting of Standard Error on our plots we are going to create a few functions. Please copy and run these lines. The first function determines the stardard error (se) of a data set using the formula se = sd/sqrt(n). 
```{r , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
se <- function(x) sd(x) / sqrt(length(x)) #get SE
se.min <- function(x) (mean(x)) - se(x) #to make SE min.
se.max <- function(x) (mean(x)) + se(x) #to make SE max.
```

Make a mean +/-SE plot.
Here we use stat_summary() and the functions we made above.
```{r}

ggplot(dat, aes(x=status, y=count,fill=status)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="bar") + #add bar at mean
  stat_summary(fun.min = se.min, fun.max = se.max, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1) #add error bars

```


We can make this plot smarter using theme_bw() and titles
```{r}

status<-ggplot(dat, aes(x=status, y=count,fill=status)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="bar", colour="black") +
  stat_summary(fun.min = se.min, fun.max = se.max, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1) +
  # Labels
  xlab("Marine sanctuary")+
  ylab(bquote('Density of legal rock lobster (no. /10 m'^2*')'))+
  ggtitle("Density of legal lobster")+
  # Apperance
  theme_bw()

status

```

Q1. What do you think this plot indicates about the difference in lobster densities between fished and no-take sites?


## Save a plot
Here we use ggsave(), you can specify the format of the plot, it's size and many other settings. By default the function will use the last plot made and set the size of the plot to the size of the plotting window. 

```{r}

ggsave("status.barplot.png")

```


## Keep on plotting
If you want to learn more about ggplot() just Google on StackOverflow and other help forums.
Also see http://www.cookbook-r.com/Graphs/ for some handy plotting and formatting help.


## Data analysis
Now for our data analysis of the **control and impact** example data.

The data we are using had many factors, including Year (mulitple years of data), Status (fished or no-take), Locations (name of sanctuary to which samples are attributed) and Sites (representative sampling sites inside and outside the no-take areas).

To adequately account for the complexity of the spatial and temporal structure and nesting of the data would require an analysis beyond this lab. To find out how to analyses this data more comprhensively check out the Masters unit BIOL4408 - Marine Ecology.


In the mean time we will use a simple but instructive data analysis to test if there is an overall difference in the number of greater than legal sized lobster between the fished and no-take areas sampled adjacent to and inside the two sanctuaries of interest.

Again we will use a simple linear model. But this time we will construct an Analaysis of Variance between the factors of Status and Sanctuary location.

```{r}
lobster <- lm(count ~ status*sanctuary, data = dat)
anova(lobster)

```

We have 3 variables in this model. 
- status indicates that Fished and No-take sites have different densities
- sanctuary indicates that our two sites (Armstrong Bay and Green Island) have different lobster densities
- there is a strongly significant (P < 0.001) interaction between Status and Sanctuary location.

To understand what this means lets make a plot. 
```{r}

status.sanctuary<-ggplot(dat, aes(x=status, y=count,fill=status)) + 
  stat_summary(fun=mean, geom="bar", colour="black") +
  stat_summary(fun.min = se.min, fun.max = se.max, geom = "errorbar", width = 0.1) +
  # Labels
  xlab("Marine sanctuary")+
  ylab(bquote('Density of legal rock lobster (no. /10 m'^2*')'))+
  ggtitle("Density of legal lobster")+
  # Apperance
  theme_bw()+
  facet_grid(.~sanctuary) # to plot by the factor of interest

status.sanctuary

```
This plot compares lobster density between Fished and No-take areas for the two sites (Armstrong and Green Island). We can see that in both sites there are more lobster in the No-take areas, but the effect of No-take is much greater at Green Island. 

We can conduct pairwise comparisons to generate some statistics around these differences across sites. 


```{r}
emmeans(lobster, pairwise ~ sanctuary*status)$contrasts
```

Q2. What is the estimate comparing the fished and non-fished sites at Armstrong Bay? 

Q3. Is this value significant? 

Q4. What is the estimate comparing the fished and non-fished sites at Green Island?

Q5. Is this value significant? 

### Wrapping up

Our analysis suggests that no-take areas around rottnest have increased the density of lobster. If we recall the life-cycle of the Western Rock Lobster (lecture 3 on biological oceanography) this might be surprising. Lobster are known to undergo large migrations to spawn - how can a small no-take area off Rottnest protect a species that moves around so much? Recent studies have suggested that not all lobster undergo this migration, and particularly large lobster in unfished locations seem  pre-disposed to become long-term residents in small spatial areas. 

A second conclusion from our study is that no-take areas had a greater impact on lobster densities at Green Island relative to Armstrong Bay. There are a variety of explanations for why this might be. At present we are not sure of the answer. As we learnt in the lecture, you should expect the unexpected. 

### Biological oceanogrpahy in fisheries lab
Now that you have completed this marine reserves lab you should go onto the biological oceanography in fisheries lab. You can find it [here](https://github.com/UWA-SCIE2204-Marine-Systems/Biological-oceanography/blob/master/Puerulus-settlement.md)
